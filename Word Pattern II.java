/*
	Similar to 290. Word Pattern.
	But here given a pattern and a dictionary, find all satisfied words.
	
	Here we only consider char maps to char.

	For example, pattern "abba" can match "cddc" or "rggr", cannot match "aaaa" or "avvv"
	
	Follow up: If we need to query many times without changing dictionary, how to optimize it?
