写一个hashmap，要求底层实现是bst，  get(key) 函数和 set(key, value) 函数


Another common implementation(besides linked-list) for a hash table is to use a BST as the underlying data structure.
It refers to the same thing as the original question: the use of BST is only when collisions occur, which means that the buckets part will be implemented as BST/List not the hash-map itself!
